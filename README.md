This repository contains code for a manuscript entitled **"Instability of a surface jet over rough topography"**, by A. Palóczy and J. H. LaCasce, submitted to the Journal of Physical Oceanography. This [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/apaloczy/RoughOceanQGEnergetics/blob/main/index.ipynb) provides an overview of the contents.

The directory `plot_figs/` contains Jupyter notebooks used to produce the figures in the manuscript (Figures 1-10). These notebooks depend on the data files in the `simulations/` and `data/` directories. Scripts to generate some ancillary data files are also in the `data/` directory.

Files in the `simulations/` directory are generated by running the codes in the `code_simulations/` directory. These codes simulate a two-layer quasigeostrophic system linearized about a surface-trapped mean zonal jet in a doubly-periodic domain over rough bottom topography, implemented with the [`FourierFlows.jl`](https://github.com/FourierFlows/FourierFlows.jl) package.
